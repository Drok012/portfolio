    <h2>summery: </h2>
    <p>Based on the technical data I acquired as an autodidact and fast learner,
        while working as a mechanical engineer in technology companies, I bring with
        me a decade of experience sharing insights that helped advance
        organizations forward. I am looking for my next challenge and following my
        passion of analyzing data, turning it into new insights as a data analyst.</p>
