<h1>Best Dror's movies</h1>

<h2>My top 3 movies of all time.</h2>

<hr />

<h3>El bueno el bruto i el cativo, the good the bad and the ugly</h3>

<p>
    This old fassioned movie might seems too slow today,
    with long monologs, long silences, and to many atmosphier shots.
    but when you look closly you can see how every scean is important,
     you can hear that half of the conversations has a cachfrase,
      how the movie is dealing with some moral questions such as 
      good and bad, war, and partnership. Altho it is very long 
      it is wort watching again and agian.

<h3> Fight club</h3>
<p>
    We don't talk about fight club, but this movie is just awsome.
    and it has the gratest surprise in the end
</p>

<h3>Dune</h3>

<p>
    I just love this world, Arakis, and its story.
    This story never got to be told propperly on a screen.
    this movie just made it happend
